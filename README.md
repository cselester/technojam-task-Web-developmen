# Project Overview

This project consists of two tasks, each focusing on different areas of front-end web development. Below are the details of each task:

## Task 1: Responsive Grid Layout

Task 1 was straightforward, as it involved creating a simple responsive grid layout using **HTML** and **CSS**. I employed CSS Grid and Flexbox properties to achieve a highly responsive design that adapts to three screen sizes: **laptop**, **tablet**, and **mobile phone**.

### Key Features:
- Utilized **CSS Grid** for the main layout structure.
- **Flexbox** was used for handling smaller sections of content.
- The layout adjusts seamlessly for different devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across screen sizes.

## Task 2: Language Translator

In Task 2, I developed a **language translator** using the **MyMemory API**, which doesn't require an API key and is easy to access. This task was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### Key Features:
- Integrated **MyMemory API** for translation functionality.
- The API is simple to use and doesn't require an API key for basic usage.
- User-friendly interface with basic styling.

## Challenges:
- Due to limited experience with the **MERN** stack, I was unable to implement **JWT authentication** for the project.
